Tomorrow morning I will be one of the member of a PhD committee at the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](http://www.upc.edu), UPC, in Barcelona, Spain. The PhD defense will be held at the *Institut d’Organització i Control de Sistemes Industrials* and will deal with the modeling, simulation and control of a magnetically coupled boost converter.
