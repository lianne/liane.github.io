Today, from 5pm to 7pm, I will give a talk at the [Universidad Industrial de Santander][uis], in Bucaramanga, Colombia. 

Actually, the talk will be in **teleconference** (I have never been in South America...;-)) and it is related to the [I3RES][i3res] EU project dealing with smart grids.

Why such a talk? [Prof. Ricardo Alzate][alzate] invited me to discuss about research stuff within his course to Master and PhD students. I hope they will enjoy! :-)
