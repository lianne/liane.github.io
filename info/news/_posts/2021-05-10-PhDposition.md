section: Info
---

The Group for Research and Control Engineering (GRACE) of the **University of Sannio in Benevento, Italy**, is looking for a highly motivated researcher to develop her/his **PhD thesis in control systems**, in particular working on methodologies and key technologies for the development of safe and autonomous drones. Click [here](info/news/2021/05/10/PhDposition.html).

The candidate will work mainly for the COMP4DRONES project, [https://www.comp4drones.eu](https://www.comp4drones.eu), an H2020-ECSEL JU research project. The thesis will be focused on the scientific challenges related to model checking and abstraction applied to drones, viewed as complex cyber-physical systems. The goal is to propose methodologies and technical solutions for designing autonomous drones that guarantee specific formal properties by taking into account the physical model, the control architecture, and incorporate perception from the environment. 

The ideal candidate is expected to have a background in the following areas: control systems, mathematical programming and robot control. Programming expertise in C/C++ or Python and familiarity with ROS and Gazebo will be highly appreciated. Candidates with a solid mathematics background will be preferred.


**Application procedure**

In order to apply to the PhD position, candidates SHALL go through the procedure illustrated in the Call for Competition available at the following link: [https://www.unisannio.it/it/amministrazione/avviso/20210138-11](https://www.unisannio.it/it/amministrazione/avviso/20210138-11). A reference letter (at least one) is required. In addition, candidates are invited to fill-in the following form for giving a quick overview of relevant information and for an informal interview: [https://forms.gle/e4EWfAXvKxDhF3uX9](https://forms.gle/e4EWfAXvKxDhF3uX9). **The deadline for the application is the 31st of May (strictly).** 

**Practical info**

The PhD program has a 3 year duration and the student will be supervised by a university professor ([prof. Luigi Iannelli](http://home.ing.unisannio.it/iannelli)) and a postdoc researcher (Dr. Valerio Mariani). 
University of Sannio is located in the historical centre of Benevento, a small city in the inner part of Campania, South Italy, where life and neighborhoods are particularly pleasant for student life. PhD salary in Italy is established by law, about 15kâ‚¬/year (gross) and it is surely adequate with respect to the cost of living in Benevento.
