The IEEE First International Conference on Control, Measurement and Instrumentation ([CMI2016](https://www.cmi2016india.org)) will be held on January 8-10, 2016 in Kolkata, India. The Conference is  organized by IEEE Joint CSS-IMS Kolkata Chapter and technically co-sponsored by IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society. 

As a member of the Technical Program Committe... ;-) I would like to invite you to look at the [call for papers](https://www.cmi2016india.org/call-for-papers.html).
