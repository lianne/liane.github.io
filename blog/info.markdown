Colophon
--------
The posts in the blog are written in a hybrid of [Markdown][] (for text) and
[LaTeX][] (for equations) and converted into HTML by [MaRuKu][] as part of 
the [Jekyll][] engine. 

[My entire site](/) is managed this way and there are more details about the 
design and technology I use at the main site's [colophon][].
