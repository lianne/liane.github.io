Research
========
I am an associate professor of automatic control and my research interests include analysis and control of switched and nonsmooth systems and application of control theory to power electronics. 

## Research topics

- Linear complementarity systems.
- Stability in piecewise-linear systems.
- UAV modeling and control
- Modeling and control of power electronics converters.
- Control of smart grids
- Hardware-In-the-Loop methodologies for real-time simulation.
- Automotive control.

See my [publications]({{ site.urlbase }}/papers/) page for my journal and conference papers.  


## PhD supervision

I am currently supervising **Alfonso Madera** who works on underwater robotics.

Please [contact me](mailto: luigi.iannelli@unisannio.it) if you are interested in working on a subject related to my research interests.
