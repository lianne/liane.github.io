My Teaching Statement
========

> “You can’t teach people everything they need to know. The best you can do is position them where they can find what they need to know when they need to know it.”  
> - ***Seymour Papert**, MIT*

> “Before printing, it was very difficult to create books, and so someone would read the books to everybody who would copy them down. The word ‘lecture’ comes from the Latin word meaning ‘to read’.”  
> - ***Joe Redish**, Professor of Physics, University of Maryland*
