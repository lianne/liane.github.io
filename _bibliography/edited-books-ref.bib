	abstract = {Automotive transmissions are fundamental components in modern vehicles. They are required to make the engine operating at the most efficient conditions for providing the necessary torque at the wheels and minimising the fuel consumptions. Moreover, transmissions should be able to smooth or to filter out power source torque oscillations that can appear in the driveline. For achieving such objectives, the automotive industry has looked at different technological solutions. The introduction of electronically controlled transmissions contributed to augment the possibilities of new solutions that would not have been implementable without the flexibility and the performance of electronic control. Thus, recent technological developments of automotive transmissions gave the opportunity to engineers and control scientists for investigating challenging control problems with daily life practical applications.},

@incollection{Srinivasan:2016cb,
	abstract = {This investigation proposes a CPES architecture and model for engineering energy management application for smart grids. In particular, the investigation considers the implementation of the power systems state estimator (PSSE). The CPES architecture has three layers: physical, monitoring and applications. The physical layer consists of the grid and the various components. Since, the grid is usually engineered with various devices from multiple vendors that have different protocols and standards; data aggregation becomes a problem. The second layer of the CPES architecture overcomes this problem by proposing a middleware that aggregates data from the physical layer. The topmost layer is the applications layer, where the energy management system applications are implemented. These applications require the model, topology and information from the grid. This requires combining the physical aspects of the grid with the cyber ones. This investigation uses the common information model to model the grid and information exchanges. Then the model is combined with measurement and optimization models of the application to realize the PSSE. The proposed approach is illustrated on a Norwegian distribution grid in Steinkjer. Our results show that the CPES approach provides an easier way to engineer future smart grid applications.},

	abstract = {The increasing complexity of modern ground vehicles is making crucial the role of control for improving energetic efficiency, comfort and performance. At the same time, the control software must be frequently updated in order to let the vehicle respond safely and efficiently within more sophisticated environ- ments and to optimize the operations when new vehicle components are integrated. In this framework real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulations represent a fundamental tool for supporting the verification and validation processes of the control software and hardware. In this chapter a railway case study will be presented. The mathematical models of the most relevant electromechanical components of the vehicle powertrain are presented: the pantograph connected to an ideal overhead line with continuous voltage; the electrical components of a pre-charge circuit, the line filter and the braking chopper; the three-phase voltage source inverter and the induction motor; and, finally, the mechanical transmission system, including its interactions with the rail. Then the issues related to the real-time simulation of the locomotive components models are discussed, concentrating on challenges related to the stiff nature of the dynamic equations and on their numerical integration by combining field programmable gate array.},

The future aim of the research collaboration is to develop and test advanced navigation, control and fault detection algorithms running over an easily accessible, customizable platform in real flights. This collaboration resulted in a flight research platform which can be easily configured with different guidance, navigation and control algorithms including an easy way of code development and testing. The paper focuses on the fine-tuning of the system components implemented by SZTAKI and BME. The related work includes sensor calibration, modification of autopilot code and testing of simple PID control algorithms. The latest flight test results are included in the paper.},
