	abstract = {We present a novel approach for solving path-planning problems using a state-of-the-art data-driven deep learning technique. Although machine learning has been previously utilized for path planning, it has proven to be challenging due to the discrete nature of search algorithms. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based algorithm for path planning, which incorporates a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) to create an end-to-end trainable neural network planner. This planner is then combined with the A* algorithm through an adaptive autonomy concept to autonomously select the best path planning strategy for increasing time efficiency and completeness. To train the CRNN, a labeled data set is generated autonomously from various maps by changing the starting and endpoints. The trained CRNN can find the shortest path from the starting point to the goal point by evaluating map images in one go. Additionally, the CRNN can predict way-points on image inputs. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed strategy is capable of finding the shortest path much faster than the A* algorithm in sparse environments, achieving a speed-up of up to 831 in some cases, which is exceptional.},

	abstract = {Single and dual dry clutches are widely used in automated manual transmissions because of their reliability and efficiency, low fuel consumption, reduction of pollutant emissions. These goals are achieved by adopting a ``good'' clutch model and by designing a robust control strategy. For this purpose, the clutch torque estimation is a key issue as it can be used to implement a feedback action in order to compensate for the temperature effects and model uncertainties. In this paper a transmissibility model of a dry clutch which includes the thermal effects is proposed and used for the design of a corresponding closed-loop control strategy. The control action consists of two contributions, one based on the inversion of the torque characteristic and another derived from an estimate of the clutch torque through an observer. A start-up engagement maneuver in a medium size passenger car is considered to validate the controller and its effectiveness is confirmed by numerical results.},

	abstract = {{The term differential-algebraic inclusions (DAIs) not only describes the dynamical relations using set-valued mappings, but also includes the static algebraic inclusions, and this paper considers the problem of existence of solutions for a class of such dynamical systems described by the inclusion
$$\dfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} P x \in -\mathcal{m}(x)$$
for a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, and a maximal monotone operator $\mathcal{M} : \mathbb{R}^n \mapto \mathbb{R}^n$. The existence of solutions is proved using the tools from the theory of maximal monotone operators. The class of solutions that we study in the paper have the property that, instead of the whole state, only $Px$ is absolutely continuous and unique. This framework, in particular, is useful for studying passive differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) coupled with maximal monotone relations. Certain class of irregular DAEs are also covered within the proposed general framework. Applications from electrical circuits are included to provide a practical motivation.}},

In this paper a dynamic model for a peak power tracker EPS architecture with an unregulated bus for small satellites is proposed. The model is used to verify the solar array and the battery sizing under different operating conditions.

	abstract = {The main motivation of this work is to show, for educational purposes, that the visual based object tracking problem can be illustrated through the simulation-in-the-loop approach:by using the MathWorks VirtualRealityToolbox together with Matlab, it is possible to simulate the behavior of a drone in a 3D environment when detection and control algorithms are run. Matlab VR is used due to the familiarity that students have with. In this way the attention can be moved to the classifier, the references generator and the trajectory tracking control. Each block is decoupled and independent, so it can be easily replaced with others thus simplifying the development phase.
The virtual environment allows to test quickly the flight control system, comparing and evaluating different plans, both for indoor and outdoor scenarios. The system acquires frames from the virtual world, searches for one or more target on which it has been trained using machine learning techniques, and it extracts information about the pose in order to apply a trajectory control.
A simple case study has been presented in order to show the effectiveness of the approach.},

	abstract = {Optimal operation of energy grids integrated with renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage systems (ESS) is challenging due to intermittencies in generation and dynamics of the storage. This investigation presents a multi-period alternate current optimal power flow (ACOPF) algorithm for reducing the grid operating cost. The proposed approach uses a receding horizon strategy that solves a non-linear optimization problem during each period by using forecasts and storage dynamics. As a result, the proposed algorithm can optimize the grid operations considering the intermittent renewable generation and storage dynamics. The multi-period ACOPF is illustrated on a Norwegian distribution network with 85 buses and our results illustrate the suitability of the multi-period approach to optimize the grid operations with RES and ESS.},

	abstract = {The integration of renewable energy sources into modern electrical grids contributes to satisfying the continuously increasing energy demand. This can be done in a sustainable way since renewable sources are both inexhaustible and non-polluting. Different renewable energy devices, such as wind power, hydro power, and photovoltaic generators are available nowadays. The main issue with the integration of such devices is their irregular generation capacity (in particular for wind and solar energy). Therefore energy storage units are used to mitigate the fluctuations during generation and supply. In this paper we formulate a model for the Alternate Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem consisting of simple dynamics for energy storage systems cast as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The effect of energy storage is examined by solving a Norwegian demo network. The simulation results illustrate that the addition of energy storage, along with demand based cost functions, significantly reduces the generation costs and flattens the generation profiles.},

	abstract = {The increased efficiency and quality constraints imposed on the electrical energy have determined a renewed research interest in the study of formal approaches for the analysis and control of power electronics systems. These systems can be viewed as networks composed by semiconductor switches (e.g. thyristors, BJTs, MOSFETs, diodes), along with electrical passive elements (e.g. inductors, capacitors, resistors) and current/voltage sources. The peculiarities of the corresponding operating conditions justify, within the control research community, the specific classification of switched electronic systems. Indeed, idealized switched models of power converters introduce problems not commonly encountered when analyzing generic switched models or non-switched electrical networks. For instance, the presence of diodes in power converters can lead to state dependent commutations of the switched model which are not directly controllable. In that sense the analysis of switched electronic systems can represent a source for new ideas and benchmarks also for the more general class of switched and hybrid systems. The main goal of the tutorial session is to propose, through practical examples and applications, contributions on recent advances regarding modeling and control techniques for switched electronic systems in the specific areas of Averaging, Model Predictive Control and Complementarity Systems.},

By discretizing the dynamics a mixed complementarity problem is formulated. The corresponding solution provides an accurate prediction of the steady-state oscillation and its period.

	abstract = {An increasing interest of the control community is currently dedicated to reducing the computation time of implicit model predictive controllers, even by looking at algorithms able to get ``good'' suboptimal solutions and which could be more efficiently implemented in real time. To this aim the potentialities of the weighted barrier function approach has been widely demonstrated in the literature. In this work it is addressed the issue of increasing performances of the barrier method for constrained model predictive control (MPC) through an algorithm that concurrently looks at the outcomes corresponding to different weights of the barrier functions and chooses, at each optimization stage, the ``best'' optimizing solution. The proposed idea has interesting effects with respect to the performance of the control action, particularly in the situation in which system states and inputs signals are moving close to the constraints. Good results are obtained without increasing the computation time in a significative way thanks to the parallelization. The effectiveness of the approach has been successfully validated in simulations on two different case-studies taken from the recent literature on the application of implicit MPC: the Cessna Citation 500 aircraft and a rotating antenna.},

A procedure for solving the set of constrained inequalities is presented. The absolute stability problem for Lur'e systems with unknown feedback characteristic belonging to an asymmetric domain, is shown to be tractable as a particular case.

The proposed approach follows standard tecniques for modeling, linearizing and decoupling the highly nonlinear six degrees-of-freedom dynamics of the vehicle. As a novelty in the UAV field, the participation factors analysis is applied in order to validate the decomposition into longitudinal and lateral-directional dynamics. Thus a linear quadratic regulator is developed for controlling the airspeed and the altitude, while a cascaded proportional-integral-derivative control is adopted for the heading tracking of the lateral dynamics, so to obtain the full waypoint navigation. In this work the lack of ailerons can be considered a peculiar feature of the considered platform since it determines a greater difficulty in controlling the flight of the UAV with respect to other airframe platforms.},

	abstract = {Computation of limit cycles in autonomous piece wise linear feedback systems in Lur'e form is considered. It is shown how the complementarity representation of the feedback characteristic allows to represent the discretized closed loop system as a linear complementarity system. A static linear complementarity problem, whose solutions correspond to periodic solutions of the discrete-time system, is formulated. The proposed technique is able to compute steady state oscillations with known period for continuous-time systems, so as demonstrated by simulation results on the Chua electrical circuit and on other Lur'e systems which exhibit asymmetric unstable and sliding limit cycles.},

@inproceedings{complementarity-med11,
	abstract = {In the recent literature it has been shown how it is possible to represent electrical circuits with ideal diodes as Linear Complementarity Systems (LCSs) and, in the presence of externally controlled electronic devices, as switched LCSs. In this paper we show how it is possible to model within the non-switched linear complementarity framework also switched electronic systems which include externally controlled state-dependent switchings. The model discretization allows to formulate a static complementarity problem whose solution provides the closed-loop steady-state periodic oscillation exhibited by the modulated system. The proposed approach can be applied to a wide class of power converters; a DC-DC boost converter with voltage-mode control is considered as an illustrative example.},

By exploiting complementarity representations of piecewise linear characteristics, generalized sector conditions expressed in terms of constrained relations are established. The proposed form is shown to be suitable for getting sector conditions of multi-input multi-output coupled characteristics as well as for representing classical conic sectors. Then, starting from the passivity assumption of the complementarity system representation, an operative result is obtained which allows to verify absolute stability of Lur'e systems with feedback constrained relations and possibly nonzero equilibrium.

A modular hybrid dynamic model of the entire power electronic apparatus is constructed; possible unbalanced line and load impedances are also considered. The power sharing between the converters is obtained by designing a droop controller based on local measurements of active and reactive powers. The controller is completed with a synchronous reference frame Phase Locked Loop which detects the local line voltage phase. The inverters synchronization allows a good power sharing in steady state and avoids the typical current overshoots due to the activation of one converter when the other is already operating. The controller effectiveness is tested in a realistic simulation scenario.},

Approximation results and stability analysis have been presented in the literature for dynamic systems described by switched ordinary differential equations. In this paper the averaging technique is shown to be useful also for the analysis of switched systems whose modes are represented by means of differential algebraic equations (DAEs). An approximation result is derived for a simple but representative homogenous switched DAE with periodic switching signals and two modes. Simulations based on a simple electric circuit model illustrate the theoretical result.},

	abstract = {Definition and properties of participation factors for linear time-invariant systems are reviewed and extended. It is shown that participation factors can be interpreted as the sensitivity of a given eigenvalue with respect to a corresponding entry of the system dynamic matrix and that the entries of the system matrix are a linear combination of participation factors and eigenvalues. A comparison among participation factors, residues and relative gain array is reported, showing that participation factors can be interpreted as the relative gains between states and modes.},
