	abstract = {This article studies the solutions of time-dependent differential inclusions which is motivated by their utility in optimization algorithms and the modeling of physical systems. The differential inclusion is described by a time-dependent set-valued mapping having the property that, for a given time instant, the set-valued mapping describes a maximal monotone operator. By successive application of a proximal operator, we construct a sequence of functions parameterized by the sampling time that corresponds to the discretization of the continuous-time system. Under certain mild assumptions on the regularity with respect to the time argument, and using appropriate tools from functional and variational analysis, this sequence is then shown to converge to the unique solution of the original differential inclusion. The result is applied to develop conditions for well-posedness of differential equations interconnected with nonsmooth time-dependent complementarity relations, using passivity of underlying dynamics (equivalently expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities).},

	abstract = {{Single and dual dry clutches are widely used in automotive transmissions because of their reliability and efficiency paired with low fuel consumption and reduction of pollutant emissions. A prerequisite to attain these goals in automated manual transmissions is the adoption of a ``good'' clutch model and the design of a robust control strategy. Several papers have been dedicated to modeling and engagement control of dry clutches, both in mechanical and control engineering literature. The wide practical interest of the application and the maturity of the research field motivate the need for a state of the art analysis on the topic. This paper aims at exploring clutch transmissibility models and engagement control strategies proposed in the last decades. An overview of dry clutch torque modeling is proposed together with a discussion on the main factors which affect the torque transmission, such as temperature, sliding speed, contact pressure, wear. Then, the prevalent clutch actuator architectures and control strategies are analyzed by discussing pros, cons and open issues. The survey is concluded by suggesting some topics of interest for future research.}},

@article{Maffei:jc,
	abstract = {Two Major challenges in securing reliable Optimal Power Flow (OPF) operations are: (i) fluctuations induced due to renewable generators and energy demand, and (ii) interaction and interoperability among the different entities. Addressing these issues requires handling both physical (e.g., power flows) and cyber aspects (computing and communication) of the energy grids, i.e, a cyber-physical systems (CPS) approach is necessitated. First, this investigation proposes a receding horizon control (RHC) based approach for solving OPF to deal with the uncertainties. It uses forecasts on renewable generation and demand and an optimization model solving a predictive control problem to secure energy balance while meeting the network constraints. Second, to handle the interoperability issues, a middleware using common information model (CIM) for exchanging information among applications and the associated profiles are presented. CIM profiles modelling various components and aspects of the RHC based OPF is proposed. In addition, a middleware architecture and services to collect information is discussed. The proposed CPS approach is illustrated in a distribution grid in Steinkjer, Norway having 85 nodes, 700 customers, 3 hydrogenerators, and various industrial loads. Our results demonstrate the benefits of CPS approach to implement OPF addressing also the interoperability issues.},

@article{Maffei:2017go,
	abstract = {Energy management in electric grids with multiple energy sources, generators, storage devices, and interacting loads along with their complex behaviours requires grid wide control. Communication infrastructure that aggregates information from heterogeneous devices in the electric grid making the applications completely independent of physical connectivity are essential for building in the context of control applications. This investigation presents a semantic middleware that is used to implement a receding horizon based optimal power flow in smart grids. The presence of renewable energy sources, storage systems and loads dispersed all along the grid necessitates the use of grid wide control and a communication infrastructure to support it. To this extent the proposed middleware will serve as the basis for representing various components of the power grid. It is enriched with intelligence by semantic annotation and ontologies that provide situation awareness and context discovery. The middleware deployment is demonstrated by implementing the receding horizon OPF in a network in Steinkjer, Norway. Our results demonstrate the advantages of both the middleware and the algorithm. Furthermore, the results prove the added flexibility obtained in the grid due to the addition of renewable energy and storage systems. The significant advantage of the proposed approach is that the real-time monitoring infrastructure is used for improving the flexibility, reliability and efficiency of the grid.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the theory of robust min--max control is extended to hierarchical and multiplayer dynamic games for linear quadratic discrete time systems. The proposed game model con- sists of one leader and many followers, while the performance of all players is affected by disturbance. The Stackelberg--Nash-saddle equilibrium point of the game is derived and a necessary and suffi- cient condition for the existence and uniqueness of such a solution is obtained. In the infinite time horizon, it is shown that the solution of the Riccati equation is upper bounded under a condition that is called individual controllability. By assuming such a condition and using a time-varying Lyapunov function the input-to-state stability of the hierarchical dynamic game is achieved, considering the opti- mal feedback strategies of the players and an arbitrary disturbance as the input.},

In this paper, the com- plementarity framework is used for computing peri- odic steady-state trajectories belonging to linear time- invariant systems with PWL, possibly set-valued, feed- back relations. The computation of the periodic solu- tions is formulated in terms of a mixed quadratic com- plementarity problem. Suitable anchor equations are used as problem constraints in order to determine the unknown period and to fix the phase of the steady- state oscillation. The accuracy of the complementarity problem solution is shown through numerical investi- gations of stable and unstable oscillations exhibited by practical PWL systems: a neural oscillator, a deadzone feedback system, a stick--slip system, a repressilator and a relay feedback system.},

In this paper a solution based on a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) approach is proposed. The state estimation is obtained by using a LED photoelectrothermal dynamic model whose parameters are tuned through a procedure here presented. By exploiting the dynamic separation within the thermal state variables of the model, the junction temperature is predicted by using LED current and heat sink temperature measurements. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through simulations and experiments on different heat sinks and samples of the same LED family, thus confirming the achievement of the luminous flux tracking under current and temperature constraints typically featuring LED applications.},

The evolutions of the electrical variables are determined by the state-dependent switchings, which complicate the mathematical modeling of controlled power converters. Differently from the complementarity models previ- ously presented in the literature, the model proposed in this paper allows to represent as a linear complementarity system also closed-loop power converters, without requiring the a priori knowledge of the converter modes. A model construction procedure, not dependent on the specific converter topology, is presented. The discretization of the continuous-time model allows to formulate mixed linear complementarity problems for the computation of the control-to-output frequency response and the evolutions of both transient and steady-state currents and voltages. As illustrative examples Z-source, boost and buck DC-DC power converters under voltage-mode control and current-mode control operating both in continuous and discontinuous conduction modes are considered.},

When the switching is periodic and of high frequency, the question arises whether the solutions of switched DAEs can be approximated by an average non-switching system. It is well known that for a quite general class of switched ordinary differential equations (ODEs) this is the case. For switched DAEs, due the presence of the so-called consistency projectors, it is possible that the limit of trajectories for faster and faster switching does not exist. Under certain assumptions on the consistency projectors a result concerning the averaging for switched DAEs is presented. },

@article{clutch-TMECH11,
	abstract = {Dry clutches are widely used in conventional and innovative automotive drivelines and represent a key element for automated manual transmissions (AMTs). In practical applications, it is fundamental to model the clutch behavior through its torque transmissibility characteristic, i.e., the relationship between the throwout bearing position (or the pressure applied by the clutch actuator) and the torque transmitted through the clutch during the engagement phase. In this paper, a new model for the torque transmissibility of dry clutches is proposed. It is analyzed how the transmissibility characteristic depends on: friction pads geometry, cushion spring compression, cushion spring load, and slip-speed-dependent friction. Corresponding functions are suitably composed determining the torque transmissibility expression. An experimental procedure for tuning the characteristic parameters is presented. The clutch-torque transmissibility model is tested on a detailed cosimulation model with a typical AMT controller.},

We employ the so-called linear switched systems framework in which these circuits can be analyzed for any given switch configuration. After providing a complete characterization of admissible inputs and consistent initial states with respect to a switch configuration, the paper introduces a new state reini- tialization rule that is based on energy minimization at the time of switching. This new rule is proven to be equivalent to the classical methods of Laplace transform and charge/flux conservation principle. Also we illustrate the new rule on typical examples that have been treated in the literature.},

@article{comp-TPE09,
	abstract = {The switching behavior of power converters with ldquoidealrdquo electronic devices (EDs) makes it difficult to define a switched model that describes the dynamics of the converter in all possible operating conditions, i.e., a ldquocompleterdquo model. Indeed, simplifying assumptions on the sequences of modes are usually adopted, also in order to obtain averaged models and discrete-time maps. In this paper, we show how the complementarity framework can be used to represent complete switched models of a wide class of power converters, with EDs having characteristics represented by piecewise-affine (even complicated) relations. The model equations can be written in an easy and compact way without the enumeration of all converter modes, eventually formalizing the procedure to an algorithm. The complementarity model can be used to perform transient simulations and time-domain analysis. Mathematical tools coming from nonlinear programming allow to simulate numerically the transient behavior of even complex power converters. Also rigorous time-domain analysis is possible without excluding pathological situations like, for instance, inconsistent initial conditions and simultaneous switchings. Basic converter topologies are used as examples to show the construction procedure for the complementarity models and their usefulness for simulating the dynamic evolution also for nontrivial operating conditions.},

@article{dither-CEP08,
	abstract = {High-frequency dither signals are commonly used to implement modulation schemes in power electronics converters. These systems represent an interesting class of hybrid systems with external excitation. They have a rich dynamical behavior, which cannot be easily understood intuitively. Despite the common use of averaging techniques in power electronics, it was only recently proved that a dithered hybrid system can be approximated by an averaged system under certain conditions on the dither signal. Averaging and averaged models for various types of power converters are analyzed in the paper. It is shown that the averaged nonlinearity depends on the dither shape and that dither signals with Lipschitz-continuous averaged nonlinearities can be used to adapt the equivalent gain of power converters. Practical stability of the original dithered system can be inferred by analyzing a simpler averaged system. The main contribution of the paper is to show that the averaged and the dithered systems may have drastically different behavior if the assumptions of the recently developed averaging theory for dithered hybrid systems are violated. Several practical experiments and simulation examples of power electronics converters are discussed. They indicate that the conditions on the dither signal imposed by the averaging theory are rather tight.},

@article{steadystate-TCAS111,
	abstract = {Computation of periodic steady state in nonlinear circuits is a key issue. Power electronics converters represent an interesting class of switched nonlinear circuits. The behavior of the converter is obtained by the commutations of the electronic devices which determine the switchings among the different converter modes. Switchings can be classified as external, if forced by directly manipulable control variables, and internal if determined by state dependent conditions. The presence of internal switchings makes it difficult to know a priori the sequence of modes and also open loop steady-state behaviors are difficult to be obtained. In this paper the complementarity modeling framework is proposed as a possible approach for computing periodic steady-state oscillations in power converters with internal switchings. It is shown how linear complementarity systems can be used to model the behavior of a wide class of power converters. The discretization of such model allows to formulate a static complementarity problem whose solution provides the steady-state oscillation of the converter. It is proved that the backward zero-order-hold technique preserves passivity through the discretization and allows to determine the unique solution of the complementarity problem. A resonant converter and a dc/dc voltage-mode controlled buck converter are used as examples.},
