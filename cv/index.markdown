Short biography
===============

I was born in Benevento, Italy, in 1975. I got the "Laurea" degree in computer engineering from the University of Sannio in Benevento in 1999 and the PhD in information engineering from [University of Napoli Federico II][unina]{: rel="_blank"} in 2003. In 2002 I was visiting student at the [Royal Institute of Technology][kth]{: rel="_blank"} (KTH), in Stockholm, and in 2003 I was there as a guest researcher (I was the responsible of the Automatic Control Project course) working with [Prof. Karl Johansson][kalle]{: rel="_blank"}. 
Since December 2004 I work at the University of Sannio in Benevento, Italy, firstly as assistant professor and then (May 2016) as associate professor of automatic control.
